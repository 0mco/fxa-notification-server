Firefox Accounts Notification Server
====================================

This is an experimental hub service for handling account event notifications
in the Firefox Accounts ecosystem.  Service Providers will be able to use it
to publish notifications of various events, and Reliers will be able to use it
to subscribe to said notifications.

It's most definitely *not* ready for production use.

In fact, there's not even any code here yet, just some notes and bugs and
ideas...
